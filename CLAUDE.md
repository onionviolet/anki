# Claude Code Configuration

> **Note:** Every command you need — building, running, testing, linting,
> formatting — is defined as a recipe in the project `justfile`. Run
> `just --list` to see them. Do not invoke `./ninja`, `./run`, or scripts
> under `./tools` directly — use the `just` recipes instead.

## Project Overview

Anki is a spaced repetition flashcard program with a multi-layered architecture. Main components:

- Web frontend: Svelte/TypeScript in ts/
- PyQt GUI, which embeds the web components in aqt/
- Python library which wraps our rust Layer (pylib/, with Rust module in pylib/rsbridge)
- Core Rust layer in rslib/
- Protobuf definitions in proto/ that are used by the different layers to
  talk to each other.

## Running Anki

To build and run Anki in development mode:

```
just run
```

This builds pylib and qt, then launches Anki with debugging enabled. Web
views are served at http://localhost:40000/_anki/pages/ (e.g.,
deckconfig.html). Use `just run-optimized` for a release-optimized build.
For live-reloading during web development, run `just web-watch` in a
separate terminal — it monitors ts/, sass/, and qt/aqt/data/web/ and
auto-rebuilds on changes (`just rebuild-web` triggers a one-off rebuild).

## Building/checking

`just check` will format the code and run the main build & checks.
Please do this as a final step before marking a task as completed.

Run `just` (or `just --list`) to see all available commands.

## Release notes

When developing a user-visible feature, update `RELEASE.md` in the same
change, even if the feature has not been released yet. Add it to the existing
unreleased section so the release notes remain current throughout development.

## Releases

Push the exact release commit and wait for its complete remote CI matrix before
dispatching a draft or public release. Use the `just release::draft` recipe for
drafts; its local preflight waits for CI and only dispatches the GitHub release
workflow after CI succeeds. If CI fails, fix the failure, push the new commit,
and run the recipe again. Do not invoke `release.yml` directly or pass
`--skip-ci-check=true` unless the user explicitly requests bypassing the CI
gate.

## Quick iteration

During development, you can build/check subsections of our code:

- Rust: `cargo check`
- Python: `just lint` (runs mypy/ruff), and if wheel-related, `just wheels`
- TypeScript/Svelte: `just lint` (includes check:svelte and check:typescript)

Language-specific tests are also available: `just test-rust`, `just test-py`,
`just test-ts`. Use `just fmt` / `just fix-fmt` for formatting and
`just fix-lint` to auto-fix lint issues.

TypeScript/Svelte browser e2e tests live in `ts/tests/e2e/` and run with
`just test-e2e`. The harness launches a temporary Anki instance and drives
mediasrv pages with Playwright's Chromium.

When a bug involves UI state, focus, event timing, shortcut/click routing,
embedded webviews, or async reviewer transitions, do not rely on unit tests
alone if the behavior remains uncertain. Add or run a targeted runtime/UI
smoke test using the existing harness where possible, such as Playwright e2e,
an offscreen temporary Anki reviewer session, or another small mock UI flow
that exercises the user interaction end to end.

## Testing with the user's collection

By default, when a test needs data from the user's Anki collection, use an
existing backup from
`/Users/jschoreels/Library/Application Support/Anki2/Main Profile/backups/`.
Choose a suitable backup (normally the most recent), copy it to a dedicated
temporary directory under `/private/tmp` or the workspace, and extract or use
the copy there as needed. Never extract, open, or modify the backup in place,
and never point test or analysis tools at the live profile database.

An existing backup may be used without asking the user to quit Anki. If the
test requires collection state newer than the available backups, or requires
modifying or restoring the active profile, ask the user first and follow the
Anki SQLite safety workflow.

Be mindful that some changes (such as modifications to .proto files) may
need a full build with `just check` first.

## Testing guidance

Before adding or changing unit or component tests, read and follow the
[Writing Unit Tests for Anki](docs-site/developers/unit-testing.mdx).

## Build tooling

`just` recipes wrap our build system (implemented in build/), which takes
care of downloading required deps and invoking our build steps. See the
project `justfile` for the full set of recipes.

## Translations

ftl/ contains our Fluent translation files. We have scripts in rslib/i18n
to auto-generate an API for Rust, TypeScript and Python so that our code can
access the translations in a type-safe manner. Changes should be made to
ftl/core or ftl/qt. Except for features specific to our Qt interface, prefer
the core module. When adding new strings, confirm the appropriate ftl file
first, and try to match the existing style.

## Protobuf and IPC

Our build scripts use the .proto files to define our Rust library's
non-Rust API. pylib/rsbridge exposes that API, and \_backend.py exposes
snake_case methods for each protobuf RPC that call into the API.
Similar tooling creates a @generated/backend TypeScript module for
communicating with the Rust backend (which happens over POST requests).

## Fixing errors

When dealing with build errors or failing tests, invoke 'check' or one
of the quick iteration commands regularly. This helps verify your changes
are correct. To locate other instances of a problem, run the check again -
don't attempt to grep the codebase.

## Ignores

The files in out/ are auto-generated. Mostly you should ignore that folder,
though you may sometimes find it useful to view out/{pylib/anki,qt/\_aqt,ts/lib/generated} when dealing with cross-language communication or our other generated sourcecode.

## Installer

The code for our Briefcase-based installer is in qt/installer, with
separate templates for each platform (mac-template/, linux-template/,
windows-template/).

## Rust dependencies

Prefer adding to the root workspace, and using dep.workspace = true in the individual Rust project.

## Rust utilities

rslib/{process,io} contain some helpers for file and process operations,
which provide better error messages/context and some ergonomics. Use them
when possible.

## Rust error handling

in rslib, use error/mod.rs's AnkiError/Result and snafu. In our other Rust modules, prefer anyhow + additional context where appropriate. Unwrapping
in build scripts/tests is fine.
